# Protocol 1: The Personal Defense
## Master the Tool, Don't Serve It (The "No Vibe Coding" Standard)

> **Navigation:** [🏠 Home](../README.md) | [🛡️ Protocols Index](README.md) | **Protocol 1** | [Protocol 2: Operational Defense](02_operational_defense.md)

**"Vibe Coding"** is the practice of accepting AI-generated code because it *looks* right, without verifying if it *is* right. It is the primary source of the Subprime Code Crisis. 

Before we change the industry, we must discipline our own workflow. We are the architects of logic, not consumers of syntax.

### 1. The Containment Rule

Until AI demonstrates true architectural reasoning and context awareness, restrict autonomous code generation to "Safe Zones." Do not let the AI dictate the architecture.

#### 🟢 Green Zone (AI Allowed)
*Use AI freely for these tasks to accelerate throughput:*
*   **Disposable Scripts:** One-off data migration or parsing scripts.
*   **Data Transformation:** Converting JSON to SQL, mapping types.
*   **Boilerplate:** Generating standard class structures, getters/setters (if not using Lombok/Records).
*   **Unit Test Scaffolding:** Generating the *structure* of tests (but review the assertions manually).
*   **Documentation Drafts:** Initial Javadoc/Docstring generation.

#### 🔴 Red Zone (Human Only)
*Do not accept AI output without forensic audit:*
*   **Core Business Logic:** The algorithms that define the company's value proposition.
*   **Security Controls:** AuthZ/AuthN logic, encryption handling, input validation.
*   **State Management:** Complex React hooks, database transaction boundaries, concurrency controls.
*   **Architectural Decisions:** Choosing patterns, defining API contracts, system design.

### 2. The Career Hedge (The "Fixer" Premium)

Be mentally prepared to be ignored. You might not be heard the first time. Your anchor is the realization that even if the situation worsens today, your market value in 2–3 years will likely double. 

**Not** because you learned to prompt, but because you possess the foundational engineering skills required to repair the structural damage being inflicted on codebases right now. You are not being left behind; you are becoming the specialist who will be paid to clean up the mess.

*   **Action:** Focus your learning on **System Design**, **Debugging**, **Security**, and **Performance Tuning**. These are the skills AI struggles with most.

### 3. The Commitment

To maintain professional integrity, adopt this stance:

> **"Refuse to normalize 'coding by probability'. If I didn't read it, I didn't write it. If I don't understand it, I won't commit it."**

You are the signatory of the code. The `git blame` points to you, not the LLM. Act accordingly.
