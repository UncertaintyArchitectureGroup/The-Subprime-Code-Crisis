This repository relies on empirical data, not marketing hype. Below is the complete list of primary research, industry reports, and theoretical frameworks cited in the **Subprime Code Crisis** analysis.

## 🧪 Primary Research (The Data)

**METR (Model Evaluation & Threat Research)**
*   [Measuring the Impact of Early-2025 AI on Experienced Open-Source Developer Productivity](https://metr.org/blog/2025-07-10-early-2025-ai-experienced-os-dev-study/) (July 2025)
    *   *Key Finding:* Experienced developers were **19% slower** when using AI, despite feeling 20% faster.
*   [Measuring AI Ability to Complete Long Tasks](https://metr.org/blog/2025-03-19-measuring-ai-ability-to-complete-long-tasks/) (March 2025)
    *   *Key Finding:* AI agents have a **50% failure rate** on tasks requiring ~7 hours of human effort.

**Academic & Large Scale Studies**
*   **Xu et al. (arXiv, 2025):** ["AI-Assisted Programming Decreases the Productivity of Experienced Developers"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10165)
    *   *Key Finding:* Analysis of 10,000+ developers. Seniors saw **-19% coding output** and **+6.5% review load**. Peripheral contributors increased output by +43.5%.
*   **Agarwal et al. (arXiv, 2026):** ["AI IDEs or Autonomous Agents? Measuring the Impact of Coding Agents"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13597)
    *   *Key Finding:* AI-generated code contains **+18% static analysis warnings** and **+39% higher cognitive complexity** compared to human code.
*   **Peng et al. (arXiv, 2023):** ["The Impact of AI on Developer Productivity"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.06590)
    *   *Key Finding:* 55.8% speedup on greenfield tasks for less-experienced developers (foundational positive evidence).

**GitClear**
*   [AI Assistant Code Quality 2025 Research](https://www.gitclear.com/ai_assistant_code_quality_2025_research) (2025)
    *   *Key Finding:* Code churn is up, reuse is down (<10%), and copy/pasted code has increased by ~10x.
*   [How much more productive are AI-powered developers?](https://www.gitclear.com/research/ai_tool_impact_on_developer_productive_output_from_2022_to_2025) (2022-2025)
    *   *Key Finding:* Net productivity gain is only **~10%** when accounting for rework.
